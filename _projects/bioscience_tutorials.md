The [full set of tutorials](https://github.com/cnellington/bioscience-python-tutorials)
covers 3 advanced computing applications in the life sciences:
- Building a command-line interface for DNA or protein sequence alignment
- Simulating and modeling how neurons interact in the human brain
- Distilling information from the sequence of the SARS-Cov2 surface glycoprotein
Each tutorial takes around 60 minutes to complete. Start with whichever one interests you the most!
