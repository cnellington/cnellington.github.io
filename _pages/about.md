Check out our demos on [contextualized.ml](http://contextualized.ml), a statistical machine learning toolbox for estimating powerful biological models at per-patient or per-cell resolution, enabling truly personalized modeling for healthcare and precision diagnostics.

My research interests span meta-learning, multi-task learning, graphical models, and biological modeling.
I primarily work on adaptive and sample-efficient machine learning methods that respond to new challenges by using knowledge gathered in many different environments.
I'm particularly interested in using these tools to understand heterogeneous diseases, like cancer and COVID-19, where genetic and environmental factors change the mechanisms of disease in every case, making them difficult to observe in isolation.

I also enjoy bouldering, music, languages, my cats Mimi and Goma, and my rats Boogie and Disco.
