I work on AI/ML for biology to enable automated biomarker discovery, drug repurposing, and therapeutic target identification for heterogeneous and rare diseases. 
My research interests span foundation models, probabilistic graphical models, biological modeling, and multi-task learning. 

I co-created [contextualized.ml](https://github.com/cnellington/contextualized), an sklearn-style toolbox for personalized modeling with heterogeneous observational data. 
Contextualized Machine Learning is a novel machine learning paradigm that estimates models, functions, and distributions at sample-specific resolution, allowing per-patient or per-cell analysis of biomedical data and enabling truly personalized modeling for healthcare, precision diagnostics, and drug repurposing.

I also enjoy rock climbing, running, backpacking, guitar, learning languages, and wild speculation about Spotify's recommender system.
I've lived in Austin TX, Seattle WA, and Pittsburgh PA and I call them all home.
