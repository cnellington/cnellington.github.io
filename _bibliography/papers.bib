	shorttitle = {{NOTMAD}},
	abstract = {Context-specific Bayesian networks (i.e. directed acyclic graphs, {DAGs}) identify context-dependent relationships between variables, but the non-convexity induced by the acyclicity requirement makes it difficult to share information between context-specific estimators (e.g. with graph generator functions). For this reason, existing methods for inferring context-specific Bayesian networks have favored breaking datasets into subsamples, limiting statistical power and resolution, and preventing the use of multidimensional and latent contexts. To overcome this challenge, we propose {NOTEARS}-optimized Mixtures of Archetypal {DAGs} ({NOTMAD}). {NOTMAD} models context-specific Bayesian networks as the output of a function which learns to mix archetypal networks according to sample context. The archetypal networks are estimated jointly with the context-specific networks and do not require any prior knowledge. We encode the acyclicity constraint as a smooth regularization loss which is back-propagated to the mixing function; in this way, {NOTMAD} shares information between context-specific acyclic graphs, enabling the estimation of Bayesian network structures and parameters at even single-sample resolution. We demonstrate the utility of {NOTMAD} and sample-specific network inference through analysis and experiments, including patient-specific gene expression networks which correspond to morphological variation in cancer.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of discovering K related Gaussian directed acyclic graphs ({DAGs}), where the involved graph structures share a consistent causal order and sparse unions of supports. Under the multi-task learning setting, we propose a l1/l2-regularized maximum likelihood estimator ({MLE}) for learning K linear structural equation models. We theoretically show that the joint estimator, by leveraging data across related tasks, can achieve a better sample complexity for recovering the causal order (or topological order) than separate estimations. Moreover, the joint estimator is able to recover non-identifiable {DAGs}, by estimating them together with some identifiable {DAGs}.  Lastly, our analysis also shows the consistency of union support recovery of the structures. To allow practical implementation, we design a continuous optimization problem whose optimizer is the same as the joint estimator and can be approximated efficiently by an iterative algorithm. We validate the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the joint estimator in experiments.},

	abstract = {Testing multiple treatments for heterogeneous (varying) effectiveness with
respect to many underlying risk factors requires many pairwise tests; we
would like to instead automatically discover and visualize patient
archetypes and predictors of treatment effectiveness using multitask
machine learning. In this paper, we present a method to estimate these
heterogeneous treatment effects with an interpretable hierarchical
framework that uses additive models to visualize expected treatment
benefits as a function of patient factors (identifying personalized
treatment benefits) and concurrent treatments (identifying combinatorial
treatment benefits). This method achieves state-of-the-art predictive
power for {COVID}-19 in-hospital mortality and interpretable identification
of heterogeneous treatment benefits. We first validate this method on the
large public {MIMIC}-{IV} dataset of {ICU} patients to test recovery of
heterogeneous treatment effects. Next we apply this method to a
proprietary dataset of over 3000 patients hospitalized for {COVID}-19, and
find evidence of heterogeneous treatment effectiveness predicted largely
by indicators of inflammation and thrombosis risk: patients with few
indicators of thrombosis risk benefit most from treatments against
inflammation, while patients with few indicators of inflammation risk
benefit most from treatments against thrombosis. This approach provides an
automated methodology to discover heterogeneous and individualized
effectiveness of treatments.},
