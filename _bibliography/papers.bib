	abstract = {Context-specific Bayesian networks (i.e. directed acyclic graphs, {DAGs}) identify context-dependent relationships between variables, but the non-convexity induced by the acyclicity requirement makes it difficult to share information between context-specific estimators (e.g. with graph generator functions). For this reason, existing methods for inferring context-specific Bayesian networks have favored breaking datasets into subsamples, limiting statistical power and resolution, and preventing the use of multidimensional and latent contexts. To overcome this challenge, we propose {NOTEARS}-optimized Mixtures of Archetypal {DAGs} ({NOTMAD}). {NOTMAD} models context-specific Bayesian networks as the output of a function which learns to mix archetypal networks according to sample context. The archetypal networks are estimated jointly with the context-specific networks and do not require any prior knowledge. We encode the acyclicity constraint as a smooth regularization loss which is back-propagated to the mixing function; in this way, {NOTMAD} shares information between context-specific acyclic graphs, enabling the estimation of Bayesian network structures and parameters at even single-sample resolution. We demonstrate the utility of {NOTMAD} and sample-specific network inference through analysis and experiments, including patient-specific gene expression networks which correspond to morphological variation in cancer.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of discovering K related Gaussian directed acyclic graphs ({DAGs}), where the involved graph structures share a consistent causal order and sparse unions of supports. Under the multi-task learning setting, we propose a l1/l2-regularized maximum likelihood estimator ({MLE}) for learning K linear structural equation models. We theoretically show that the joint estimator, by leveraging data across related tasks, can achieve a better sample complexity for recovering the causal order (or topological order) than separate estimations. Moreover, the joint estimator is able to recover non-identifiable {DAGs}, by estimating them together with some identifiable {DAGs}.  Lastly, our analysis also shows the consistency of union support recovery of the structures. To allow practical implementation, we design a continuous optimization problem whose optimizer is the same as the joint estimator and can be approximated efficiently by an iterative algorithm. We validate the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the joint estimator in experiments.},

	abstract = {Testing multiple treatments for heterogeneous (varying) effectiveness with
respect to many underlying risk factors requires many pairwise tests; we
would like to instead automatically discover and visualize patient
archetypes and predictors of treatment effectiveness using multitask
machine learning. In this paper, we present a method to estimate these
heterogeneous treatment effects with an interpretable hierarchical
framework that uses additive models to visualize expected treatment
benefits as a function of patient factors (identifying personalized
treatment benefits) and concurrent treatments (identifying combinatorial
treatment benefits). This method achieves state-of-the-art predictive
power for {COVID}-19 in-hospital mortality and interpretable identification
of heterogeneous treatment benefits. We first validate this method on the
large public {MIMIC}-{IV} dataset of {ICU} patients to test recovery of
heterogeneous treatment effects. Next we apply this method to a
proprietary dataset of over 3000 patients hospitalized for {COVID}-19, and
find evidence of heterogeneous treatment effectiveness predicted largely
by indicators of inflammation and thrombosis risk: patients with few
indicators of thrombosis risk benefit most from treatments against
inflammation, while patients with few indicators of inflammation risk
benefit most from treatments against thrombosis. This approach provides an
automated methodology to discover heterogeneous and individualized
effectiveness of treatments.},

	shorttitle = {Contextualized Policy Recovery},
	abstract = {Interpretable policy learning seeks to estimate intelligible decision policies from observed actions; however, existing models fall short by forcing a tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. This tradeoff limits data-driven interpretations of human decision-making process. e.g. to audit medical decisions for biases and suboptimal practices, we require models of decision processes which provide concise descriptions of complex behaviors. Fundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they represent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact human decisions are dynamic and can change drastically with contextual information. Thus, we propose Contextualized Policy Recovery ({CPR}), which re-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task learning problem in which complex decision policies are comprised of context-specific policies. {CPR} models each context-specific policy as a linear observation-to-action mapping, and generates new decision models \${\textbackslash}textit\{on-demand\}\$ as contexts are updated with new observations. {CPR} is compatible with fully offline and partially observable decision environments, and can be tailored to incorporate any recurrent black-box model or interpretable decision model. We assess {CPR} through studies on simulated and real data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the canonical tasks of predicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units (\$+22{\textbackslash}\%\$ {AUROC} vs. previous {SOTA}) and predicting {MRI} prescription for Alzheimer's patients (\$+7.7{\textbackslash}\%\$ {AUROC} vs. previous {SOTA}). With this improvement in predictive performance, {CPR} closes the accuracy gap between interpretable and black-box methods for policy learning, allowing high-resolution exploration and analysis of context-specific decision models.},

Contextualized {ML} estimates heterogeneous functions by applying deep learning to the meta-relationship between contextual information and context-specific parametric models. This is a form of varying-coefficient modeling that unifies existing frameworks including cluster analysis and cohort modeling by introducing two reusable concepts: a context encoder which translates sample context into model parameters, and sample-specific model which operates on sample predictors. We review the process of developing contextualized models, nonparametric inference from contextualized models, and identifiability conditions of contextualized models.

	abstract = {Cancers are shaped by somatic mutations, microenvironment, and patient background, each altering gene expression and regulation in complex ways, resulting in heterogeneous cellular states and dynamics. Inferring gene regulatory network ({GRN}) models from expression data can help characterize this regulation-driven heterogeneity, but network inference requires many statistical samples, traditionally limiting {GRNs} to cluster-level analyses that ignore intra-cluster heterogeneity. We propose to move beyond cluster-based analyses by using contextualized learning, a multi-task learning paradigm which allows us to infer sample-specific models using phenotypic, molecular, and environmental information pertinent to the model, encoded as the model's "context" to be conditioned on. We unify three network model classes (Correlation, Markov, Neighborhood) and estimate context-specific {GRNs} for 7997 tumors across 25 tumor types, with each network contextualized by copy number and driver mutation profiles, tumor microenvironment, and patient demographics. Contextualized {GRNs} provide a structured view of expression dynamics at sample-specific resolution, which reveal co-expression modules in correlation networks ({CNs}), as well as cliques and independent regulatory elements in Markov Networks ({MNs}) and Neighborhood Regression Networks ({NNs}). Our generative modeling approach allows us to predict {GRNs} for unseen tumor types based on a pan-cancer model of how somatic mutations affect gene regulation. Finally, contextualized networks enable {GRN}-based precision oncology, explaining known biomarkers in terms of network-mediated effects, and leading to novel subtypings for thyroid, brain, and gastrointestinal tumors that improve survival prognosis.},
