_Contextualized Networks Reveal Heterogeneous Transcriptomic Regulation in Tumors at Sample-Specific Resolution_ is online now on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.01.569658v1).
We introduce a new machine learning paradigm for sample-specific inference of probabilistic graphical models, and show that sample-specific models of transcriptional regulation are highly accurate, interpretable, and prognostic across 25 tumor types and nearly 8000 patints.
I'll be sharing significant updates to the method and results at [NeurIPS 2023 GenBio Workshop](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2023/workshop/66505).
