The _Contextualized Machine Learning_ White Paper is online at arXiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11340).
We explore applications, algorithms, and extensions for contextualized models: models that understand heterogeneity in real data, adapt to new environments, and are explainable by design.
This work outlines the vision for the [Contextualized ML](https://contextualized.ml) project, which I co-created with Ben Lengerich and has transformed into a fast-growing reasearch community.
